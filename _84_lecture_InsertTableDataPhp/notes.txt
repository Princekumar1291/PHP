Key Differences Between include and require

Error Handling:
  include: Issues a warning (E_WARNING) if the file cannot be included, and the script continues execution.
  require: Issues a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) if the file cannot be included, and the script stops executing.

Use Cases:
  include: Suitable for files that are not critical to the application's execution. Use include when the file is optional or not essential for the script to function properly.
  require: Suitable for files that are critical to the application's execution, such as configuration files or essential libraries. Use require when the file is mandatory for the script to work.

Behavior:
  include: Allows the script to continue running even if the file is missing, which is useful when you have fallback logic or optional components.
  require: Stops the script execution, making it useful for ensuring that required files are present and preventing the script from running with missing dependencies.
