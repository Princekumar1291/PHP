In PHP, require and include are both used to include and evaluate a file in your script, but they have some key differences in how they handle errors:

require: If the file cannot be found or included, require will generate a fatal error and stop the script execution. This is useful when the file is essential for the application to run.
include: If the file cannot be found or included, include will generate a warning, but the script will continue to execute. This is useful when the file is not critical to the rest of the script.
