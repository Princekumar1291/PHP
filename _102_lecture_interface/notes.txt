What is Interface ?
• Interfaces tell what methods a class should implement.


Interface VS Abstract Class
• Interfaces cannot have rp erties, while abstract classes can.
• All interface methods must be public, While abstract class methods are public or protected
• All methods in an interface are abstract, so they cannot be implemented in code and the abstract keyword is not necessary
