Cookies and sessions are both used to store data about a user in a web application, but they have distinct differences in how they work, where the data is stored, and their security implications. Here's a comparison between cookies and sessions:

1. Storage Location:
  Cookies:
    Stored on the client-side, specifically in the user's web browser.
    The data in cookies is sent back and forth between the client and server with each HTTP request.
  Sessions:
    Stored on the server-side.
    The session data is not directly exposed to the client; instead, a session ID is stored in the user's browser, which is used to reference the session data on the server.

2. Data Size:
  Cookies:
    Typically limited to around 4KB of data.
    Suitable for small pieces of data like user preferences, remember-me functionality, etc.
  Sessions:
    Can handle much larger amounts of data since the data is stored on the server.
    Suitable for storing sensitive data like user authentication details.
